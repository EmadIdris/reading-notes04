# List
There are lots of occasions when we 
need to use lists. HTML provides us with 
three different types

+ Ordered lists

> are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.

+ Unordered lists

> are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order)

+ Definition lists

> are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms

****
# Ordered Lists

> Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ol>
element to specify the type of 
numbering (numbers, letters, 
roman numerals and so on). It 
is better to use the CSS liststyle-type property covered 
on pages 333-335.

# Unordered Lists

> Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ul>
element to specify the type of 
bullet point (circles, squares, 
diamonds and so on). It is better 
to use the CSS list-styletype property covered on pages 
333-335.

# Definition Lists

> Sometimes you might see a list 
where there are two terms used 
for the same definition or two 
different definitions for the same 
term

****

# Nested Lists

> Browsers display nested lists 
indented further than the parent 
list. In nested unordered lists, 
the browser will usually change 
the style of the bullet point too

## Summary LISTS

+ There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition. 
+ Ordered lists use numbers.
+ Unordered lists use bullets.
+ Definition lists are used to define terminology.
+ Lists can be nested inside one another

****
# BOXES
+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
+ You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
+ You can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.
+ It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.
+ Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
+ Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.
+ CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
borders and rounded borders.

# ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

![Array](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/w3CWlvnWqG5VEy6qupnAYvTqECGhPdj3P9Wu)

## CREATING AN ARRAY 

> You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 
The values are assigned to the 
array inside a pair of square 
brackets, and each value is 
separated by a comma. The 
values in the array do not need 
to be the same data type, so you 
can store a string, a number and 
a Boolean all in the same array.

## VALUES IN ARRAYS

> Values in an array are accessed as if they are in 
a numbered list. It is important to know that the 
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

## ACCESSING & CHANGING VALUES IN AN ARRAY

> The first lines of code on the left 
create an array containing a list 
of three colors. (The values can 
be added on the same line or on 
separate lines as shown here.)

# Decisions and Loops

## IF Statement

![IF Statement](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/js-if-else-statement.png)

## USING IF STATEMENTS

> In this case, the statement 
evaluates to true (because the 
score is 75, which is greater than 
50). Therefore, the contents 
of the statements within the 
subsequent code block are 
run, creating a message that 
congratulates the user and tells 
them to proceed

## SWITCH STATEMENTS 

![SWITCH STATEMENTS](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OMByWcUPPBw/maxresdefault.jpg)

## TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING
> If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, 
it tries to make sense of the operation rather 
than report an error.

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES 

![False](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*fYDCaOWdYvuzqBYl_r8XEQ.png)

![True](https://miro.medium.com/max/636/1*pH1E_o1VPZMUtE3J-uZPYQ.png)

## CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE

> Because the presence of an object or array can 
be considered truthy, it is often used to check 
for the existence of an element within a page. 

## SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES

## LOOPS

## For

![for](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For-Loop-in-JavaScript.png)

## While
> Here is an example of awhil e 
loop. It writes out the 5 times 
table. Each time the loop is run, 
another calculation is written 
into the variable called msg. 
This loop will continue to run 
for as long as the condition in 
the parentheses is true. That 
condition is a counter indicating 
that, as long as the variable 
i remains less than 10, the 
statements in the subsequent 
code block should run.

## USING DO WHILE LOOPS
> The key difference between 
a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e 
loop is that the statements in 
the code block come before the 
condition. This means that those 
statements are run once whether 
or not the condition is met.

****

+ Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 
+ Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 
+ Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 
+ if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
+ if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
+ switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 
+ Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
+ All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
+ There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
