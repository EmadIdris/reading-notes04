# Duckett HTML&CSS

## Links

> Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another — enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing

> Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page

> At the top of a long page 
you might want to add a list 
of contents that links to the 
corresponding sections lower 
down. Or you might want to add 
a link from part way down the 
page back to the top of it to save 
users from having to scroll back 
to the top.

# Summary Links

+ Links are created using the <a> element.
+ The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.
+ If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
+ You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.
+ You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to

# Layout

# Summary Layout
+ <div> elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.
+ Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
+ The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
+ Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
+ Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
+ Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
+ CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
+ You can include multiple CSS files in one page

## Functions , Methods & Objects

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

> Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

## Summary
+ Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 
+ Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 
+ An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
+ In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
+ Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

> Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.
More “two heads are better than one” than “stop reading over my shoulder,” pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.

### How does pair programming work?

> While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

### Why pair program?
1. Greater efficiency

> it is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product)

2. Engaged collaboration

> When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your screen.

3. Learning from fellow students

> Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.


4. Social skills

> Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

5. Job interview readiness

> A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

6. Work environment readiness

> Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
