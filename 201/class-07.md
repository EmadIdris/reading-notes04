# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams

# Tables

+ The  element is used to add tables to a web 
page.
+ A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the <tr> element.
+ Inside each row there are a number of cells 
represented by the <td> element (or  if it is a 
header).
+ You can make cells of a table span more than one row 
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
+ For long tables you can split the table into a

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

> The object-oriented extension of Objective CAML is integrated with the functional and imperative kernels of the language, as well as with its type system. Indeed, this last point is unique to the language. Thus we have an object-oriented, statically typed language, with type inference. This extension allows definition of classes and instances, class inheritance (including multiple inheritance), parameterized classes, and abstract classes. Class interfaces are generated from their definition, but may be made more precise through a signature, similarly to what is done for modules.

When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That’s architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or “Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” by G. Booch, and more.
