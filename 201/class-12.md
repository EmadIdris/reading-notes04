# Readings : Chart.js, Canvas

## Chart.js

> Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

> A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

> To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

***

## Setting up

> The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.

***

## Drawing a line chart

> To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page.


> Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart. Add this immediately above the line that begins ‘var buyers=’

***

## Drawing a pie char

> You’ll notice that this time, we are going to supply some options to the chart.

> Next we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section

## Basic usage of canvas

> At first sight a looks like the  element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the  element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

> The id attribute isn't specific to the element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element (like class for instance). It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.

> The element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. We'll see how this is done in a dedicated chapter of this tutorial. When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.

***

## Fallback content

> The  element differs from an  tag in that, like for  elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

> Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the  element. Browsers that don't support  will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support  will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.

***

# The rendering context

+ The  element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.

+ The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The  element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions. getContext() takes one parameter, the type of context. For 2D graphics, such as those covered by this tutorial, you specify "2d" to get a CanvasRenderingContext2D.

# Drawing paths

Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:

1. First, you create the path.
2. Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
3. Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <script type="application/javascript">
    function draw() {
      var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
      if (canvas.getContext) {
        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(200, 0, 0)';
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);

        ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.5)';
        ctx.fillRect(30, 30, 50, 50);
      }
    }
  </script>
 </head>
 <body onload="draw();">
   <canvas id="canvas" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
 </body>
</html>
```
### A skeleton template

``` 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Canvas tutorial</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        }
      }
    </script>
    <style type="text/css">
      canvas { border: 1px solid black; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body onload="draw();">
    <canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
  </body>
</html>

```

```
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                       Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ', 0)';
      ctx.fillRect(j * 25, i * 25, 25, 25);
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced text measurements

> 
In the case you need to obtain more details about the text, the following method allows you to measure it.
measureText() , Returns a TextMetrics object containing the width, in pixels, that the specified text will be when drawn in the current text style.
The following code snippet shows how you can measure a text and get its width.

```
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  var text = ctx.measureText('foo'); // TextMetrics object
  text.width; // 16;
}

```
