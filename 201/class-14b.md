## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

> It’s a lot like dining out with a bunch of friends. Where to go? Italian? Vegetarian? Steakhouse? Each person has their own appetite, which can make creating a “shared-interest” extremely challenging.

## The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’

After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

1. Psychological safety
2. Dependability
3. Structure and clarity
4. Meaning
5. Impact

## Not all researchers agree

> While Google’s findings may be true to some extent, a large number of scientific studies have caused researchers (outside of Google’s lab) to shockingly disagree. They claim the exact opposite — that personality, not just skills, is indeed a significant factor in what makes a team successful.

## Why pragmatism is a rarely desired trait

> Employees in the medical field might not need a strong degree of creativity (a.k.a. those right brained personalities). But across the board in every business and industry, when teams come together, EQ (emotional intelligence) matters much more than IQ (intelligence quotient).
EQ, which reflects and strengthens a person’s right-brain skills, enhances self-awareness and increases humility. It is far more beneficial for the team — regardless of their skill set.
