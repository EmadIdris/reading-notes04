# CSS Layout
>At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.

+ elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.
+ Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
+ The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
+ Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
+ Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
+ Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
+ CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
+ You can include multiple CSS files in one page

## Prerequisites
1. Have basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.
2. Be comfortable with CSS fundamentals, as discussed in Introduction to CSS.
3. Understand how to style boxes.

## Introduction to CSS layout

> This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.

## Normal flow

> Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

## Flexbox

> Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals. After studying this guide you can test your flexbox skills to check your understanding before moving on.

##Grids

> CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout, then test your grid skills before moving on.

## Floats

> Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.

## Positioning

> Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another, or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values and how to use them.

## Multiple-column layout

> The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper. This article explains how to use this feature.
