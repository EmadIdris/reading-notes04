# Github
> **GitHub** allows developers to host their files in a ‘Git Repository’ so that other people can collaborate on projects with them, whether they are open for public contribution (open source) or closed for specific colleagues to work on a private project. The idea is not dissimilar to the way Google Docs lets you host your word processing and spreadsheet files and opens them up for collaboration, though developers do not work on the same documents together in real time or make changes directly in the browser.
