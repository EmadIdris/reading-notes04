**`Node.js`** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript  ***`runtime environment`*** that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

+ I have v14.17.3 installed on my device

 ``` 
 node -v
 ```

+ V8 is the JavaScript execution engine which was initially built for *`Google Chrome`*.

+ It compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code.

+ **Node.js** is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript run-time for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

**`npm`** stands for **`Node Package Manager`**, npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.

We have to ways :

1. install it globally :
    * To install the package globally run this line of code in your terminal :

    ```
    npm install -g jshint
    ```

    This will install the jshint package globally on your system.

2. install it locally :
    * We can also install packages locally to a project just run this line of code in your terminal :

    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
    This will create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder.

+ >Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.


> Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

* **The Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
